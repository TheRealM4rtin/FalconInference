# Text Generation with Quantization & Falcon-7B

This repository contains code for text generation using a language model with quantization. It utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement a text generation pipeline. Additionally, the model in this repository is quantized using the BitsAndBytes library, which allows for reduced memory and computational requirements while maintaining performance.

## Introduction

Text generation is the process of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input prompt. Language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text. However, the large size of these models can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive.

Quantization is a technique used to reduce the precision of numerical values in a model. ➜ This involves lowering the number of bits used to represent model parameters and activations. By quantizing the model, we can significantly reduce its memory footprint and speed up inference without sacrificing the overall performance.

## Inference Model

The text generation pipeline in this repository uses a pre-trained language model called "falcon-7b-instruct" from the Hugging Face model hub. ➜ The model has been quantized using the BitsAndBytes library to load parameters and activations in 4-bit format, enabling more efficient computation.

The text generation pipeline takes a query as input and generates coherent text based on the prompt. ➜ The generated text can be controlled using parameters like `max_length`, `top_k`, and `num_return_sequences`.

## Installation

To run the text generation pipeline with quantization, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:

```shell
pip install transformers einops accelerate bitsandbytes
```

2. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheRealM4rtin/FalconInference.git
cd FalconInference
```

3. Run the provided Python code to perform text generation with quantization.

## Usage

To generate text using the provided code, you can follow the example provided in the Python script. The `prompt` function allows you to input your query, and the model will generate corresponding text based on that prompt.

The text generation pipeline can be further customized by adjusting parameters like `max_length`, `top_k`, and `num_return_sequences` to control the length and diversity of the generated text.

## Understanding Quantization

Quantization is a process of converting model weights and activations from full precision (e.g., 32-bit floating-point) to lower precision (e.g., 4-bit). ➜ This reduction in precision significantly reduces the memory and computational requirements for inference. The `BitsAndBytes` library provides a configuration that enables quantization for the language model in this repository.

It is essential to note that quantization involves a trade-off between model size reduction and potential loss of model accuracy. ➜ However, with proper quantization techniques and fine-tuning, the impact on model performance can be minimized while enjoying the benefits of reduced memory and faster inference.
